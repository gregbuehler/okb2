Program Description

A Nuisance Intervention Team (NIT) was created to address the population creating nuisance offenses and victimizing citizens. A special unit of officers patrol the hot spots and offenders committing the low-level misdemeanors where people feel unsafe.
Based on Research

Yes, Intelligence-Led Policing and Hot Spots policing programs were the foundation of the program. We created the special unit to address the specific issues.
Funding

Added three additional officers to make up the Unit. Originally tried to cover with overtime but found the program difficult to be consistent.

Program Impact

Nuisance offenders have relocated to other areas away from our City for the most part and people have expressed their satisfaction with our efforts. We see less of the same people committing the same offenses that we used to. To summarize, the call volume and unsafe feelings by residents have been significantly reduced and replaced with a sense of a safe and more livable community.

Critical Success Factors

Data, the Nuisance Intervention Team (NIT), communication within the department as to the ongoing problems or people.
Lessons Learned

Commit to the program and philosophy to see results. It was not originally embraced by officers, but when they saw the results and positive feedback from citizens, they were all in.
