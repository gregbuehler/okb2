## ![Problem Icon](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/raw/master/alert/1x_web/ic_error_outline_black_48dp.png "Problem") Problem

High levels of crime, particularly violent crime, at a specific intersection (N. Killingsworth St. and Albina Ave.) The intersection was mixed use with businesses, residential homes, two primary schools and a junior college.

Multiple analyses revealed that the intersection and surrounding area was one of the top three locations that had experienced shootings in Portland. The location was at an elevated risk for pedestrian robbery in an analysis of street robbery. Finally, in an overall analysis of violent crime in the city of Portland it was found to have high levels of general violent crime. Interviews with individuals who worked or resided in the area also revealed issues related to street drinking and other low-level offenses, which created quality of life issues.
Impact on the Community

The problems at this intersection reduced the quality of life for area residents, students and workers.

The program involved a partnership among area businesses, residents, educational institutions and the police. The initial response consisted of working with neighborhood associations, businesses, local clergy, the schools and others to develop a set of expectations around appropriate behavior in the area. This was followed up by CPTED (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design), outreach to youth, working with businesses to reduce attractive nuisances such as the sale of fortified wines and malt liquors, and a brief but intense enforcement effort aimed at reinforcing the norms of behavior identified in the analysis phase. It also included direct police enforcement against specific offenses highlighted by the community (primarily street drinking, but also drug use and violent crimes) and an increased presence by community members.

The program utilized a combination of activities to create a more livable environment and enforce new norms of behavior (no street drinking, drug dealing, etc.). This included CPTED, enhanced patrol, good neighbor agreements and community foot patrols lead by local religious leaders.
Based on Research

The program utilized a Problem-Oriented Policing approach. It also used CPTED, high-visibility patrol, and CCTV.
Funding

The program utilized a portion of the time of three officers and one sergeant. Other costs were in-kind contributions from partners.

Program Impact

There was a substantial reduction in violent crime and calls for service to the area at the aggregate level. Property crime was roughly flat at the aggregate level (crime count). Because the area saw increased use there were likely reductions in terms of the rate of crime (this was not quantified).

Critical Success Factors

Community and Police collaboration as well as the involvement of local clergy, the Albina Killingsworth Safe Neighborhood Commission, local schools, including Portland Community College, and crime prevention were integral in the success of the program. Additionally, utilizing several tactics (CPTED, increased patrol, good neighbor agreements) to address the variety of issues and applying these tactics simultaneously was important.
Lessons Learned

It is important to take the time to thoroughly study the problem and develop the necessary relationships before attempting to address it.
