In 2015, the Bend Police Department (BPD) received more than 360 reports of bicycle theft. This accounted for more than 400 bicycles stolen inside city limits and represented a 49 percent increase in reports from 2014.

Program Description

The BPD responded to these finding by doing the following:

- Forming the Central Oregon Bike Theft Task force, comprising representatives from the Deschutes County Sheriff’s Office and District Attorney’s Office and police departments from Redmond, Sunriver, and Prineville;
- Developing a bike theft ”hot sheet” shared weekly with task force representatives to share with patrol officers for quick identification of outstanding bikes countywide.;
- Adopting proactive enforcement and investigative efforts from patrol officers in the field to identify serial bike thieves and locate stolen bikes;
- Forming the Bend Bike Theft Committee, with representatives from the BPD, Pine Mountain Sports, Commute Options, Visit Bend, Bendbikes.org, and BikeIndex.org;
- Partnering with BikeIndex for fast, free, and easy online bike registration at the BPD and at points of sale;
- Partnering with the community-based Bend Bike Theft Committee to generate awareness among local bike shop owners through the first Bend Bike Theft Summit;
- Implementing “bait bike” sting operations structured around crime analysis; and
- Increasing community awareness of how, when, and where bike thefts are likely to occur. based on local crime analysis.

Based on Research

The Bend Police Department has followed the Problem-Oriented Policing model to implement this program, reviewing existing programs and adjusting it to fit community and project needs. The Redlands Police Department in California offered guidance on the bait bike portion and the Portland Police Bureau provided guidance about its Bike Theft Summit.
Funding

Funding and costs for this program is minimal.

Program Impact

As a result of all efforts, including the support and participation of community partners, bike theft in Bend has dropped more than 60 percent, based on a year-over-year analysis. Since implementation of its bait-bike program, the department has made 21 arrests.

Critical Success Factors

Patrol officers focused efforts targeting serial bike thieves, familiarizing themselves with high-value bikes and components and thoroughly investigating recovered bikes to locate owners even without known serial numbers. Bait bikes became recognized and word was out as officers began finding BPD bikes labeled “Bait.” Working with local bike shops was paramount to the overall success of the program.
Lessons Learned

Make sure that bikes used in the bait-bike operations are appraised and valued to the felony level. Rotate bikes often, using two or more bikes.
