Program Description

Functional Family Probation (FFP) offers services that are community­-based, evidence­-based, and designed specifically for juveniles. It is an integrative supervision and case management model used to engage, motivate, assess, and work successfully with high-risk youth and their families. Juvenile Court Counselors (JCC) have worked diligently to implement FFP, a transformation in how high-risk youth are served in the justice system. JCCs meet with the entire family, instead of just the youth. They work hard to uncover a family’s hopes and strengths to build upon, and use highly developed skills and expertise to create motivation and alliances with the family. Finally, JCCs strive to develop credibility with each member of the family, avoiding picking sides or exercising authority over family members, including youth.

Program Impact

Functional Family Probation engages youth and families holistically in motivating, assessing, and working toward goals. The family focus, based on respect and consideration, allows staff and clients to build alliances and encourages innovative problem solving to promote positive outcomes.

Critical Success Factors

Fidelity to the model, buy­-in from staff, and continued training and support from management are critical to the success of the FFP model.
