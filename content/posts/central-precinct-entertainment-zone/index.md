Problematic Behavior or Activity

Downtown Portland North of Burnside from the Willamette River to N.W. 5th Ave. was generating large amounts of crimes and calls for service associated with the nightlife/bar scene in the area.
Impact on the Community

The area was taking considerable resources to police, negatively impacting residents' quality of life and generating a number of drinking related crimes such as assault.

Program Description

The program was modeled after a similar initiative in Vancouver, BC. It entailed street closures at certain hours of the day coupled with a dedicated walking patrol in the area and crime prevention efforts to address the problems associated with the area.
Based on Research

In addition to Vancouver, BC, other locations were consulted, such as Austin, Texas.
Funding

There is no cost estimate at this time. It did take several officers to patrol on the weekends but these officers were already spending considerable time in the area.

Program Impact

There were large reductions in Part I and II crimes in the area. Citizen calls for service were also reduced (see attached document).

Critical Success Factors

The approach was holistic (it contained enforcement, regulatory, CEPTD and educational components). It also involved close work between crime prevention specialists, police officers and the community.
Lessons Learned

Identify similar towns/counties and reach out to those agencies to see what approaches they are using. Then modify those approaches to fit with your jurisdiction.
