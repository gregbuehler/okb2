Problematic Behavior or Activity

In 2012, budgetary issues forced the closure of the Jackson County Community Justice Day Reporting Center. The closure of this center left Jackson County without a suitable alternative to pretrial incarceration for defendants and additional supervision support for offenders.
Impact on the Community

Jackson County Community Justice supervises more than 1800 offenders, with 51% identified as medium/high risk to recidivate. Many of these offenders have an increased need for resources and support including: employment resources, Drug and alcohol monitoring, enhanced/day reporting, financial assistance and medication management.
